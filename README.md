For this assignment, I have created a To-Do list application which includes the ability to delete, rename and organise tasks efficiently whilst following the MVVM format. User interface is simple and effective for those who wish to just have reminders of what they need to do. Completes most of the assignment requirements. 

Assignment Specifications:

Project Description:

For this assessment, you will be developing a practical iOS application that demonstrates your proficiency in applying object and protocol-oriented concepts. The project involves creating a user-friendly app that allows users to manage their tasks (user stories tasks) efficiently. You will be required to showcase your understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP), protocol-oriented design, user interface (UI) development, error handling, testing, debugging, and version control. You will follow the design presented in assessment 1.

Project Requirements:
 

Object-Oriented Concepts:
   - Create Classes/Protocols for tasks, implementing properties and methods that encapsulate task-related information and functionalities.

   - Implement inheritance/Composition to manage different types of tasks (e.g., personal, work, shopping) efficiently.

 

Protocol-Oriented Design:
   - Define protocols that ensure consistent behaviour across different types of tasks.

   - Apply protocol-oriented programming principles to enhance code modularity and reusability.

 

User Interface (UI) Design:
   - Develop an intuitive UI using SwiftUI, allowing users to add, edit, and delete tasks and task lists.

   - Design visually appealing screens that align with the app's purpose and provide a seamless user experience.

 

Error Handling:
   - Implement error handling mechanisms to manage scenarios such as incorrect user inputs or network connectivity issues.

   - Ensure the app gracefully communicates errors to users and provides guidance on resolving them.

 

Testing and Debugging:
   

   - Use Xcode's debugging tools to identify and fix any issues that may arise during development.

 

Version Control:
   - Create a Git repository to track your project's source code history.

   - Commit your changes regularly, providing clear and meaningful commit messages.

 

Assessment Deliverables:
 

A fully functional iOS application that allows users to manage tasks using OOP and protocol-oriented concepts as well as using the MVVM model.
Comprehensive source code documentation explaining your implementation choices and highlighting OOP and protocol implementations.
Unit tests that validate the application's core functionalities and handle various scenarios (error handling and backend management).
A Git repository containing the complete project history, including collaborative contributions if applicable.
A reflective report detailing the challenges you encountered, decisions you made, and lessons learned during the development process (optional).
 

Assessment Criteria:
 

Concept Implementation: Effective integration of OOP and protocol-oriented concepts in the application's architecture.
User Interface Design: Intuitive UI that enables users to manage tasks seamlessly.
Error Handling: Application effectively manages and communicates errors to users in a user-friendly manner.
Testing and Debugging: Unit tests ensure key functionalities work as intended, and the app is free from major bugs.
Version Control Usage: Proper use of Git for version control, including clear commit history and collaboration if applicable.
Documentation: Source code documentation highlights OOP and protocol-oriented design principles, and the reflective report provides meaningful insights into your development experience.
 

Submission and Assessment Deadline:

Submit your completed project, source code, unit tests, Git repository link, and readme file by the specified deadline. Late submissions will incur penalties.

 

Assessment Weight:
This assessment task contributes to 30% of your total course grade.
